    <h1>Bandura's Social Learning Theory</h1>
    <p>Bandura’s social learning theory emphasizes the importance of observing, modeling, and imitating the behaviors, attitudes, and emotional reactions of others. Key concepts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Observational Learning:</strong> Learning can occur through direct observation rather than solely through direct experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> The process of learning behaviors by watching others. This involves attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Attention:</strong> In order for observational learning to occur, the learner must pay attention to the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> The learner must be able to remember the behavior that has been observed.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> The learner must be able to replicate the behavior that they have observed.</li>
        <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> The learner must have the desire to perform the behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bandura's theory is significant in understanding how people, especially children, learn within a social context and influences educational practices.</p>
