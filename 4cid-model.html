    <h1>4C/ID Model for Integrated Competence Design</h1>
    <p>The 4C/ID (Four Component Instructional Design) model is a framework aimed at designing educational programs that promote integrated competence acquisition. Below are the four components of the 4C/ID model:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Learning Tasks</h2>
    <p>Learning tasks are aimed at developing the necessary competencies in learners. This includes practical scenarios, case studies, and projects that reflect real-world challenges relevant to the subject matter.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Supportive Information</h2>
    <p>This component provides learners with the necessary context and background information to understand and successfully complete the learning tasks. It includes instructional materials such as manuals, videos, and online resources that support the learning process.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Just-in-Time (JIT) Support</h2>
    <p>Just-in-Time support refers to the guidance and assistance provided to learners as they engage with learning tasks. This can include help from instructors, peers, or digital tools that guide learners through the problem-solving process when they encounter challenges.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Feedback and Assessment</h2>
    <p>Feedback and assessment components help measure learners' performance and understanding. It is crucial to provide timely and constructive feedback that guides learners in improving their skills and knowledge throughout their learning journey.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The 4C/ID model emphasizes the interplay between these components and their role in creating effective learning environments. By combining these elements, educators can provide learners with meaningful and engaging experiences that lead to integrated competence development.</p>
